the type of service. The rates are computed as follows:
Regular service: $10.00 plus the first 50 minutes are free. Charges for over 50 minutes
are $0.20 per minute.
Premium service: $25.00 plus:For calls made during the day., the first 75 minutes are free; charges for more than
75 minutes are $0.10 per minute.
‚óè For calls made during the night, the first 100 minutes are free; charges for more
than 100 minutes are $0.05 per minute.
Your program should prompt the user to enter a service code (type char), and the
number of minutes the service was used.*/
